**Effective Date:** January 15, 2026

Personal Dashboard is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle data.

### 1. Data Collection
Personal Dashboard **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personally identifiable information (PII) to external servers. All user data is handled locally within your browser.

### 2. Location Data
Our extension requests access to your Geolocation to provide local weather updates. This location data is processed locally and sent directly to the OpenWeatherMap API via a secure (HTTPS) connection to fetch weather results. We do not store or share your location.

### 3. Storage
We use `localStorage` to cache news, weather, and background images. This data remains on your device and is used solely to improve performance and reduce network requests.

### 4. Third-Party APIs
We interact with the following third-party services:
* **OpenWeatherMap:** To provide weather data.
* **NewsAPI:** To provide news headlines.
* **Unsplash:** To provide background imagery.
Please refer to their respective privacy policies for how they handle data.

### 5. Contact
